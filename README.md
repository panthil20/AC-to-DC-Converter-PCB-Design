# 12V AC to DC Converter

This repository contains the design, schematic, and PCB layout for a simple **12V AC to DC Converter** project built using KiCad. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

The project converts a 12V AC supply into a filtered DC output using a full bridge rectifier made with 1N4007 diodes, followed by a smoothing capacitor and LED indication.

### Features:
- Converts 12V AC to 12V DC
- Full-wave bridge rectifier using 4 x 1N4007
- 1000ŒºF capacitor for filtering
- LED indicator for DC output status
